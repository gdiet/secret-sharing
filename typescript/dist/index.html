  <h1>Secret Sharing</h1>
  <p>Welcome! You have come to the right place.</p>
  <p><b>If</b> you have a password or a similar important secret,</p>
  <p>and somebody may need access to it when you are not available,</p>
  <p>but you don't want to give it to a single person for safekeeping, or put it into the strong box:</p>
  <p><b>Then</b> these pages tell you how to give pieces of the secret for example to five of your friends,</p>
  <p>so that only if three of your friends put their pieces together, they can reconstruct the secret.</p>
