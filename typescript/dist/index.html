    <h1>Secret Sharing</h1>
    <p>Welcome! You have come to the right place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>If</b> you have a password or a similar important secret, and somebody may need access to it when you are not
      available, but you don't want to give it to a single person for safekeeping, or put it into the strong box:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Then</b> these pages tell you how to give pieces of the secret for example to five of your friends, so that
      only if three of your friends put their pieces together, they can reconstruct the secret.
    </p>

      Instead of 'more information', maybe you'd like to see the
      <a href="https://github.com/gdiet/secret-sharing/tree/main/typescript">source code of these pages on GitHub</a> or
      download the <a href="secret-sharing.zip">full distribution package</a> of these pages which can simply be
      unzipped and opened in a browser. It also contains the project's sources (mainly Typescript & HTML).
