    <h1>Secret Sharing</h1>
    <p>Welcome! You have come to the right place.</p>
    <p>
      <b>If</b> you have a password or a similar important secret, and somebody may need access to it when you are not
      available, but you don't want to give it to a single person for safekeeping, or put it into the strong box:
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Then</b> these pages tell you how to give pieces of the secret for example to ten of your friends, so that
      only if three (or five, or two, ...) of your friends put their pieces together, they can reconstruct the secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are looking for a way to split the password into encrypted pices so that any <b>three</b> pieces can be used to reconstruct the password, the following page is your friend:
    </p>
    <h3><a href="./sharing-passwords_3.html">=> Sharing Passwords (Three Parts Needed, Easy Math)</a></h3>
    <p>
      If any <b>two</b> pieces shall be enough to reconstruct the password, the following page is your friend:
    </p>
    <h3><a href="./sharing-passwords_2.html">=> Sharing Passwords (Two Parts Needed, Easy Math)</a></h3>
    <p>
      If you need more flexibility and do not care about a more involved algorithm (Shamir's Secret Sharing), look here:
    </p>
    <h3><a href="./share-compact.html">=> Sharing Passwords (Shamir's Secret Sharing)</a></h3>
    <h3><a href="./join.html">=> Restoring Shared Passwords (Shamir's Secret Sharing)</a></h3>
    <p>
      Instead of 'more information', maybe you'd like to see the
      <a href="https://github.com/gdiet/secret-sharing/tree/main/typescript">source code of these pages on GitHub</a> or
      download the <a href="secret-sharing.zip">full distribution package</a> of these pages which can simply be
      unzipped and opened in a browser. It also contains the project's sources (mainly Typescript / JavaScript & HTML).
