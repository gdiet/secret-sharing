    <h1>Sharing Secrets Using Simple Math</h1>
    <p id="javascriptWarning" class="problem">
      What the heck! This page needs JavaScript, and it seems that JavaScript is not enabled. Maybe you want to use a
      different browser? ... Or, maybe, the JavaScript part of this page somehow got lost...

    <p>
      If you have a password or a similar important secret, and somebody may need access to it when you are not
      available, then on this page you can 'split' the secret into multiple pieces called 'shares' that you can share
      e.g. with your friends, so that only if three shares are combined, the secret can be reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the theory behind this, see 🔴TODO🔴.
    </p>
    <p>
      For reconstructing secrets or passwords from the shares created with this tool, see 🔴TODO🔴.

        Below are the shares for your secret or password. Beneath that is a suggestion for how to share them with people
        so they know what they have received - and have a chance of remembering it in ten years' time.
      </p>
      <hr />
      <pre class="scrollable"><span id="sharesSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: the shares</span>
        <br><br>==> ==>  you may have to scroll  ==> ==>
      </pre>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The following is an example of how you might share these shares with people - modify or abbreviate as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          This is a so-called share of a secret string, for example a password.
          <span id="sharesDescriptionSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: description</span>
          Please keep it in a safe place, such as your password safe. You have been given this share so that, in an
          emergency, you - together with two other people who have been given other shares - can reconstruct the secret or
          password and do whatever is necessary. This is one of
          <span id="numberOfSharesSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: number</span> shares created on
          <span id="createdDateSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: date</span>. For the actual
          reconstruction, this text is not needed - you only need the following data:
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b><i>[Replace this paragraph with the share from above you want to hand over.]</i></b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          This share was created using the share tool at 🔴TODO🔴. On the same
          site, you will find the tool for recovering the password or other secret from a number of shares, and the
          theory behind it and the formulas used for creating shares and for recovering the secret.
        </i>

        By the way: If you are interested in the math behind this, here are the p and q values:
        <pre class="scrollable"><span id="pqValuesSpan">DYNAMISCHER TEXT: Werte von p und q</span>
        <br/>==> ==>  you may have to scroll  ==> ==></pre>
        And the p and q values for validation are:
        <pre class="scrollable"><span id="pqValidationValuesSpan">DYNAMISCHER TEXT: Werte von p und q (Validierung)
        <br/>==> ==>  you may have to scroll  ==> ==></pre>
        <b>Important:</b> The p and q values are <b>not</b> needed for sharing the password or secret.
        Do <b>not</b> give them to other persons. You do <b>not</b> have to store them anywhere.
