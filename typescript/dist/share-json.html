    <h1>Securely Sharing Secrets Like Passwords</h1>
    <p><a href="index.html">[Main Page]</a></p>
    <p id="javascriptWarning" class="problem">
      What the heck! This page needs JavaScript, and it seems that JavaScript is not enabled. Maybe you want to use a
      different browser?
    </p>
    <p id="cryptoWarning" class="problem">
      Oh bother! The hashing functionality of this page (used for verification when restoring the secret) uses
      'crypto.subtle' which is only available in a so-called secure context. It seems that your browser thinks the
      context of this page is not secure. Maybe you can use a different browser or load this page from a different
      context? Otherwise, you can't provide secret verification - the secret sharing itself is not affectd.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a password or a similar important secret, and somebody may need access to it when you are not
      available, then on this page you can 'split' the secret into multiple pieces called 'shares' that you can share
      e.g. with your friends, so that only if a certain number of shares are combined, the secret can be reconstructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an implementation of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing">Shamir's secret sharing</a>
      with an optional verification extension.
    </p>
    <p>This page creates JSON shares that look like this:</p>
    <pre class="scrollable">
{
  "part number"   : 1,
  "part of secret": "AfBJw7gpZcxCdQ==",
  "part of hash"  : "AVUZQjFENeWOEypU6MGjpXLUpcwsu/mmHZH5dER6nRmG",
  "identifier"    : "723966166016"
}

      When you create shares and give them to other people, consider including the
      <a href="secret-sharing.zip">full distribution package</a> of these pages which can simply be unzipped and opened
      in a browser. It also contains the project's sources (mainly Typescript & HTML).

        Below are the shares for your secret or password. Beneath that is a suggestion for how to share them with people

          This is a so-called share of a secret string, for example a password.
          <span id="sharesDescriptionSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: description</span>
          Please keep it in a safe place, such as your password safe. You have been given this share so that, in an
          emergency, you - along with other people who have been given other shares - can reconstruct the secret or
          password and do whatever is necessary. This is one of
          <span id="numberOfSharesSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: number</span> shares created on
          <span id="createdDateSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: date</span>. To reconstruct the secret or password,
          <span id="thresholdSpan">DYNAMIC TEXT: number</span> different shares are needed. For the actual
          reconstruction, this text is not needed - you only need the following data:

          This share was created using the share tool at

          site, you will find the tool for recovering the password or other secret from a number of shares. For sharing

          Technical description: The "part of secret" is a Base64 encoded byte array. The first byte of the array is the
          "x" value, all subsequent bytes are "y" values. To reconstruct the first byte of the original secret, you
          combine the "x" value of each "part of secret" share you have with its second byte as "y" value. This gives
          you a number of "x/y" pairs. Then you do a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial">Lagrangian interpolation</a> to calculate the "y"
          value for "x = 0". This "y" value is the first byte of the original secret. In the same way, you combine the
          "x" values with the third bytes to calculate the second byte of the secret, and so on. Ignore any trailing
          zeros in the reconstructed secret - they have been added as a security measure and are not part of the
          original secret. Note that the Lagrangian interpolation must be computed in the "GF(256)" Galois field with
          "x^8 + x^4 + x^3 + x^1 + x^0" (or 0x11b) as the reducing polynomial. By the way: This is the same field and
          polynomial used for AES encryption calculations.

      </p>
      <p>
        <i>
          From the "part of hash", you can reconstruct the SHA-256 hash of the original secret (without any zero
          padding) in the same way. This can be used to verify that the reconstructed secret is indeed the same as the
          original. The "identifier" field can be used to check whether the shares can be combined at all: if the
          identifiers are different, the shares most likely belong to different instances or even different original
          secrets, and combining them will not yield meaningful results. The "part number" field is the same as the "x"
          value of the shares. It is there to make it easier for humans to check that the shares are different - it is
          not evaluated during the reconstruction of the secrets. The approach used to share the secret or password is
          called "Shamir's Secret Sharing". Strings are converted to byte arrays (and vice versa) using the UTF-8
          encoding. Calculations are done in lower-endian order.
